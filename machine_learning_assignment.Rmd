Machine learning assignment
========================================================
The assignment was to predict the quality of barbell lifts according to measurements arranged in a test data set, after creating a model based on similar observations arranged in a training data set. I first arranged the data so that variables comprised of NA values are removed. I then divided the data into a training set, including 70% of the data, and a test set, including 30% of the data to be used for evaluating the model.
The approach for predicting the actions quality was by using a 'Random Forest' classification model. This model was employed on K-fold cross validation set with 5 cross-validations.
After the model was established I predicted the left aside test set (comprising 30% of the original training data base) to evaluate the out of sample error. 
The following Confusion Matrix give estimates to the model performance:  

Prediction  |  A  |  B |   C  |  D |   E |
---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
         A | 1555 | 104 |  25 |  19 |  33
         B |  69 | 887 |  76 |  31 | 123
         C  |  7 | 113 | 911 | 101  | 44
         D |  43 |  33 |  11 | 800 |  65
         E  |  0  |  2  |  3 |  13 | 817

Balanced Accuracy   |   0.9430  | 0.8579  | 0.9167 |  0.8995  | 0.8757
 
By the model accuracy (84%) I can evaluate the out of sample error to be around 80% (assuming some over-fitting of the model).
The actual success rate of the model in the 20 cases test data set was 75%.
